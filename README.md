# VQA Workflow Demo

There is an integrated workflow opportunity that with the right setup, we can leverage to reduce the gap between design and development during define through deploy.

The key touchpoints include:

* Design Estimation
* Make VQA a part of the process from the start
* Initial Baseline setting with Figma and Storybook
* Continuous Integration with Figma Tokens synced with github
* Regression testing with Storybook Chromatic (or Virtuoso)

This is a work in progress.

* Read more in the [docs](https://myplanet.jira.com/l/cp/KkAFmysY).
* Check out the [git repo](https://github.com/jacquesramphal/taskbox).
